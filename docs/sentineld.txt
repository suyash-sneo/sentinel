# First working MVP
1. When run, the binary runs in an infinite loop, but also listens on a unix socket in /tmp/sentinel.sock
2. It can accept the following commands (for now):
3. start config.yaml -> returns a name
4. stop name -> returns if successfully stopped

## Start
1. Start a command with the given command
2. Start watching the selected directories for changes
3. Attach a handler to that watcher which can restart the server
4. Also assign a good name for that service and return that name; once that service is running successfully

## Stop
1. Take the name
2. Look up the corresponding PID and kill it
